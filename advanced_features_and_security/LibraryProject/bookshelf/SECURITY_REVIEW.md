# Security Review for LibraryProject

## HTTPS Enforcement
- `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True` ensures all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.
- HSTS (`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`, `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`, `SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD`) enforces HTTPS at browser level.

## Secure Cookies
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS.

## Secure Headers
- `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'` prevents clickjacking.
- `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF` and `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER` mitigate MIME and XSS attacks.

## Deployment Notes
- SSL configured with Let's Encrypt and Nginx.
- Certbot used for certificate management and renewal.

## Improvement Areas
- Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) rules more tightly.
- Add monitoring for expired/expiring certificates.
